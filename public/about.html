<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hey, I'm Tiago Pereira from Madeira Island. I'm a self-taught web developer with a passion for creativity, tech, and continuous learning. 
  <p>I'm currently leveling up my skills through Angela Yu's Full-Stack Web Development course on Udemy.</p> 
  <p>I love building clean, simple, and functional websites - and I believe in learning by doing, one project at a time.</p>
